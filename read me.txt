Create a database named registration and import the sql file and run. The system can still consume the API but
it still needs the sql file to be imported.
To create your database, you may use the console provide by the Wamp Server 
where you will manually insert queries in the console window to create your database and populate it. 
Alternatively, you can create and populate your date using the GUI in the phpMyAdmin. 
To access this, just go to your browser and access 127.0.0.1. 
This will bring you a GUI with phpMyAdmin from which you can be able to create a database and 
populate the tables much simpler.

From there you can paste the file folder into the root file of the www folder if you are using WAMP or XAMPP.

From there you can access the system via localhost/customers in your browser.
